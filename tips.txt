Showcase your Figma designs: Include screenshots or interactive prototypes of your Figma designs to demonstrate your skills in user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. Consider organizing them into categories or projects to make navigation easier.

Highlight your web development projects: Showcase screenshots or provide live links to the websites you've built. Be sure to mention your role in each project and describe the technologies and frameworks you used. If possible, include information about the goals of each website and any positive outcomes achieved.

Explain your design process: For both Figma designs and websites, provide a brief overview of your design process. Explain how you approach a project, from initial research and wireframing to final design and implementation. This helps potential clients or employers understand your methodology and problem-solving skills.

Incorporate case studies: Consider creating case studies for some of your significant design or development projects. Describe the project's context, objectives, challenges faced, and how you addressed them. Include visuals, such as sketches or mockups, to provide a comprehensive view of your work.

Provide project details: For each Figma design or website, provide relevant information such as project duration, client or target audience, and any notable features or accomplishments. This adds context and demonstrates your ability to work on diverse projects.

Use Figma embeds: If possible, embed live Figma designs directly into your portfolio website. This allows visitors to interact with your designs and experience them firsthand.

Demonstrate responsiveness: Showcase how your designs and websites adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Include screenshots or provide links to responsive versions of your projects, emphasizing your attention to detail and commitment to delivering a seamless user experience across devices.

Include testimonials or feedback: If you've received positive feedback from clients or users, showcase it alongside your projects. Testimonials or quotes from satisfied clients can build trust and credibility, reinforcing the quality of your work.

Offer contact information: Make it easy for visitors to get in touch with you by providing clear contact information. Include a contact form, your email address, and links to your professional social media profiles. This encourages potential clients or employers to reach out to you for collaboration or job opportunities.
