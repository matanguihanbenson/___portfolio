About: Create a dedicated page or section where you introduce yourself and provide an overview of your background, skills, and experience. This allows visitors to learn more about you and your expertise.

Portfolio/Work: This section is the heart of your website. Organize your Figma designs and website projects into categories or projects, making it easy for visitors to browse through your work. Consider using thumbnail images or titles to represent each project and provide a brief description.

Figma Designs: If you have a separate section specifically for your Figma designs, include it in the main navigation. This way, visitors interested in your design work can directly access your Figma-related projects.

Websites: Similarly, if you have a dedicated section for your website projects, include it in the main navigation. This allows visitors specifically interested in web development to access your website-related work easily.

Case Studies: If you have in-depth case studies for certain projects, create a separate section for them. Case studies provide a more detailed analysis of your work process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented. They can be highly informative and showcase your problem-solving skills.

Blog/Articles: If you have written articles or blog posts related to your field, consider adding a blog section. This can demonstrate your expertise, thought leadership, and passion for your work. Visitors can engage with your content and gain insights from your perspective.

Contact: Include a dedicated contact page or section with your contact information, such as an email address or a contact form. Make it easy for visitors to get in touch with you for inquiries, collaborations, or job opportunities.
